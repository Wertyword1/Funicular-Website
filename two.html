          <strong>Provides a nice pleasant stroll.</strong>
          The Montmartre funicular in Paris is an extremely popular funicular that offers amazing panoramic views of the beautiful 
          city of Paris that no bus or car can ever hope to deliver. Using the funicular allows people to have almost a birds eye view of
          the wonderful city of Paris while also being close enough to the ground that you can still hear and feel the hustle of
          the city when compared to something like an aeroplane. Although the track first saw use in the year 1900, eventually the entire
          track was rebuilt in 1991 so it could utilize modern technology and allow itself to many more passengers on a daily basis. Currently the
          track boasts a full length of 108 meters as well as a vertical length of 36 meters.

          <strong>One of the oldest suspension railways in the world!!! Survived through WWII!</strong>
          The Schwebebahn Dresden funicular is Germany is a very modest funicular that often gets overshadowed by the nearby
          Schwebebahn Wuppertal, which is 13 kilometers long and is more stylish looking. However, the smaller Schwebebahn Dresden is a 
          funicular that has a very unique and coveted history that speaks to the strength and longevity of the engineering behind it. The 
          Schwebebahn Dresden is one of the oldest suspension railways in the world and has managed to remain in use and also survive throughout
          World War 2, a feat that very few funiculars around the world can boast of. Another unique aspect of the Schwebebahn Dresden can 
          only be witnessed when paying close attention and notcing that instead of riding on tracks like most funiculars, 
          the counterbalanced cars in this funicular are suspended from overhead girders or guide rails.

          <strong>Steepest Funicular in Europe with an open top and a 106 degree incline!</strong>
          The Gelmer funicular in Switzerland is an equally beautiful and terrifying open top funicular that takes its passengers
          up to Lake Gelmer at a height of 448 meters. Just from looking at pictures of the funicular you can notice that it very much
          resembles rollercoasters that are commonly found in amusement parks however, this funicular has a much higher track rise than
          most rollercoasters, boasting a track rise of 448 meters as well as a length of 1028 meters long, with the steepest part of the rising incline being a 106 degree incline.
          Luckily for those with a fear of heights, the funicular does not travel as fast as a normal roller coaster, however this still does nothing to sooth the worries
          of passengers that have a fear of heights. Those who manage to control their fear of heights are rewarded with a beautiful birds eye view of the fresh
          and luscious vegetation of Switzerland.

          <strong>Offers a breathtaking view aswell as a ride through a 260 meter tunnel.</strong>
          The Penang Hill Funicular Railway is a very popular tourist attraction in the beautiful country of Malaysia. This wonderful
          Funicular is located near the Kek Lok Si Temple which is another tourist attraction that is very spiritual and soothing. Originally
          it was created and opened as two-section railway in 1923 that saw extensive use until the entire design was overhauled and a more 
          modern system and materials were used to help stabilize the the funicular and make it more safe. One very unique thing about this
          funicular is that it takes you through a massive 260 meter tunnel that will excite even the most inattentive and bored passengers.
