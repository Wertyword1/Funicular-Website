      <h1>What Exactly is a Funicular?</h1>
      <p>         A Funicular is a is form of cable railway which connects points along a railway laid on a steep slope. 
        There are two cars whose weight is used to counterbalance one another and they are permanently attached to opposite ends of the haulage cable, which is looped  
        over a pulley at the upper end of a track. The two cars move in together: as one ascends, the other descends. 
        Funiculars are different from counterbalanced inclines which operate on a similar principle hauling vehicles 
        that are not permanently attached to the cable.</p>

          <p>         As you can see from the picture above, the funicular uses a pully system to move up and down a slope 
              so that passengers can be transported from the top of a hill to the bottom and vice versa. Typically in a modern funicular the propulsion is 
              provided by an electric motor which is linked via a speed-reducing gearbox to a large pulley â€“ a drive bullwheel. 
              The bullwheel in its turn transfers its torque to the haul rope by friction. The bullwheel has two grooves: after the first half turn around it the cable returns via an auxiliary pulley. 
              This arrangement has the advantage of having twice the contact area between the cable and the groove, and returning the downward-moving cable in the same plane as the upward-moving one. 
              Modern installations also use high friction liners to enhance the friction between the bullwheel grooves and the cable.
              For emergency and service purposes two sets of brakes are used at the engine room: the emergency brake grips directly the bullwheel, the service brake is mounted at the high speed shaft of the gear. 
              In a case of emergency the cars are also equipped with spring-applied, hydraulically opened rail brakes.

        <p>         Early funiculars used two parallel straight tracks, four rails, with separate station platforms at both ends for each vehicle. The tracks are laid with sufficient 
            space between them for the two cars to pass at the midpoint. In any funicular design, the cars always pass at the same location every trip.
             A three-rail arrangement also has two platforms at each end, but allows lower track cost while allowing the cars to pass at the half-way point.
             In layouts using three rails, the middle rail is shared by both cars, like in the early version of the Petrin funicular in Prague. A two-rail layout is the narrowest of all and needs only a single platform at each end, 
             but the required passing section is more complex and costly to build. If a rack for braking is used, 
             that rack can be mounted higher in a three-rail layout, making it less sensitive to choking in snowy conditions.
